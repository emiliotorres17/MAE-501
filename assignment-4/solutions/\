\section{Exercise 1}
\subsection{Part a}

No ``final solutions'' are provided for these types of questions, since the
whole point of them is to encourage you to express \emph{briefly} but
\emph{clearly} and \emph{in your own words} what you understand. As
explained in the directions, definitions taken from text books or the
internet do not reflect a good understanding of these terms, nor do
extremely long explanations. Equations do not express the meaning of these,
nor do literal word translations of equations show that you know what they
mean. Instead, we are looking for clear evidence that you understand what
each term means. Possible definitions for each term is provided below: 

\begin{mdframed}[style=MyFrame]
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*.)]
        \item Determinants
        \item Cramer's rule
        \item Meaning and significance of $\trext{det}A=0$
        \item Relationship between the determinant and volume
    \end{enumerate}
\end{mdframed}

\newcommand{\det}[1]{\text{det}(#1)}
\subsection{Part b}
Use the determinant rules to compute the specific determinants.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*).]
    \item Reduce $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{U}$ and show $\det{A} = \text{
            products of the pivots}$.
        \begin{equation}
            \mathbf{A} = 
            \begin{bmatrix}
                1       &       1       &       1   \\
                1       &       2       &       2   \\
                1       &       2       &       3
            \end{bmatrix}
        \end{equation}
        and
        \begin{equation}
            \mathbf{A} =
            \begin{bmatrix}
                1       &       2       &       3   \\
                2       &       2       &       3   \\
                3       &       3       &       3
            \end{bmatrix}
        \end{equation}

    \item Apply row operations to produce an upper triangular matrix
        $\mathbf{U}$ and compute the following
        \begin{equation}
            \text{det}\Bigg(
            \begin{bmatrix}
                1   &   2   &   3   &   0   \\
                2   &   6   &   6   &   1   \\
                -1  &   0   &   0   &   3   \\
                0   &   2   &   0   &   7
            \end{bmatrix}
            \bigg)
        \end{equation}
