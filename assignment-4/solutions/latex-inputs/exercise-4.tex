\section{Exercise 4}
Using python build an user defined subroutine to compute the $QR$
factorization for a square matrix $A$ with the provided pseudo code. Verify
your subroutine works by factoring the following matrix $A$ and printing
$Q$, $R$, and $A-QR$.

\begin{equation}
  A =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    12  &  -51   &  4   \\
    6   &  167   &  -68   \\
    -4  &  24    &  -41
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Next, compare the performance of your $QR$ factorization to the $LU$
factorization coded in Assignment 1 (use the solution from Assignment 1 if
you were unable to get the $LU$ factorization tool working) using $N = 10,
100, 500, 1000, 2000$.
