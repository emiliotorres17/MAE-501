\section{Exercise 3}
After solving a system linear equations $Ax=b$, we found that the complete
solutions is
\begin{equation}
    x   =
        \begin{bmatrix}
            1       \\
            0       \\
            -4
        \end{bmatrix}
        +
        \alpha
        \begin{bmatrix}
            3       \\
            2       \\
            0
        \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item (3pts) What is the rank of the matrix $A$?
    \item (2pts) How many columns and rows does $A$ have? Give all
        possibilities.
    \item (2pts) Explain why the particular solution
        $\begin{bmatrix} 1  \\  0   \\  -4 \end{bmatrix}$ is not in the row
            space.
    \item (3pts) Find a particular solution which is in the row space.
\end{enumerate}
