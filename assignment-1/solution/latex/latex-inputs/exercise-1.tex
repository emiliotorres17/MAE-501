\section{Exercise 1}
No ``solution'' are provided for these types of questions, since the whole
point of them is to encourage you to express \emph{briefly} but
\emph{clearly} and \emph{in your own words} what you understand. As
explained in the directions, definitions taken from text books or the
internet do not reflect a good understanding if these therms, nor do
extremely long explanations. Equations do not express the meaning of these,
nor do literal word translations of equations show that you know what they
mean. Instead, we are looking for clear evidence that you understand what
each term means.
