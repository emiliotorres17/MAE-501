\section{Exercise 3}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item With $b = 0, 8, 8, 20$ at $t = 0, 1,3, 4$ set up and solve the
        normal equations $A^{T}A\widehat{x}=A^{T}b$. What are the heights
        $p_{i}$ and four errors $e_{i}$. What is the minimum value $E =
        e_{1}^{2} + e_{2}^{2} + e_{3}^{2} + e_{4}^{2}$?
        
    \item Project $b = (0,8,8,20)$ onto the line $a=(1,1,1,1)$. Find
        $\widehat{x} = a^{T}b/a^{T}a$ and the projection $p=\widehat{x}a$.
        check that $e=b-p$ is perpendicular to $a$, and find the shortest
        distance $\left\|e\right\|$ from $b$ to the line through $a$.

    \item Write down three equations for the line $b = C + Dt$ to go
        through $b = 7$ at $t=-1$, $b=7$ at $t=1$, and $b=21$ at $t=2$ .
        Find the least squares solution $\widehat{x} = (C,D)$ and draw the
        closest line.

    \item Find the best line $C + Dt$ to fit  $b=4, 2 , -1, 0,0$ at times
        $t=-2, -1, 0, 1, 2$.
